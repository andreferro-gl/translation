# 🌍 Flutter Internationalization PoC with Slang

This project is a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** demonstrating how to implement internationalization (i18n) in a Flutter application using the [Slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) package.

It aims to showcase for managing translations, switching languages at runtime.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 Multi-language support (🇺🇸 English, 🇮🇹 Italian)
- 🔁 Runtime language switching
- 📁 JSON-based translation files
- 🔤 Support for plurals, RichText, interpolation, and enums
- ⚙️ Automatic translate generation with `slang_builder`

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang)
- [Slang Builder](https://pub.dev/packages/slang_builder)
